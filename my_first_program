PROGRAM my_first_program

! Purpose:
!   To illustrate some of the baisc features of a Fortran program.
!

! Declare the variables used in this program.
INTEGER :: i, j, k				! All variables are integers

! Get the variables to multiply together.
WRITE (*,*) 'Enter the numbers to multiply: '
READ (*,*) i, j

! Multiply the numbers together
k = i * j

! Write out the result.
WRITE (*,*) 'Result = ', k

! Finish up.
! STOP  ! This 'STOP' command is unnecessary as the compiler
        !  will automatically add a STOP when an "End Program" is reached.
END PROGRAM
