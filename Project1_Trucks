PROGRAM Project1_Trucks
! This project practices the Statistical Resampling Program

! Project Description:
! You run a fleet of construction trucks. Past experience shows that on any given day there is 
! a 10% chance that any one truck will break down. Write a Fortran program to determine the
! probability that on a particular day four or more trucks will have broken down.

INTEGER :: ntrial		! Number of trials for resampling
INTEGER :: ntruck		! Number of trucks in fleet

REAL :: prob4 = 0.		! Probably of greater than four trucks broken on day
