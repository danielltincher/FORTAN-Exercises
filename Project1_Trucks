PROGRAM Project1_Trucks
! This project practices the Statistical Resampling Program

! Project Description:
! You run a fleet of construction trucks. Past experience shows that on any given day there is 
! a 10% chance that any one truck will break down. Write a Fortran program to determine the
! probability that on a particular day four or more trucks will have broken down.

MPLICIT NONE

INTEGER :: ntrial		! Number of trials for resampling
INTEGER :: ntruck		! Number of trucks in fleet
INTEGER :: nouttruck = 0	! Number of trucks broken down
INTEGER :: test_crit = 0	! Number of samples that meet the test criteria
INTEGER :: i			! First do loop index
INTEGER :: j			! Second do loop index
INTEGER :: limit = 4	! Maximum number of trucks allowed to break down
REAL :: pbreak = 0.1	! Probability of truck breaking down
REAL :: r = 0.			! Generated Random number between 0 and 1

! .. read number of trials
PRINT *, 'Enter number of trials'
READ (*,*) ntrial
PRINT *, 'Number of trials entered = ', ntrial
! .. read number of trucks

DO i = 1, ntrial ! assumed increment of 1
	DO j = 1, ntruck
		CALL RANDOM_NUMBER(r)		! roll the dice for each truck
		IF ( r <= pbreak ) nouttruck = nouttruck + 1
	END DO
	IF ( nouttruck >= limit ) test_crit = test_crit + 1
END DO
